<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>A graphical hub for some <a href="https://pathofexile.com">Path of Exile</a> statistics.</p>
<h3>Where does this data come from?</h3>
<p>At the moment, we are using the data from <a href="https://poebuilds.io">poebuilds.io</a> and the official Path of Exile API.</p>
<h3>Is it finished?</h3>
<p>Not really. Weâ€™ve a lot of graphs ideas that have not been implemented yet.</p>
<h3>I have an graph idea. Where can I share it?</h3>
<p>Oh, nice! You can use Github <a href="https://github.com/tcK1/exileinfo/issues">issues</a> page for that. Just create a new issue with your graph idea. 
<strong>BUT</strong>, be aware that there may be other things more important in the making and getting to your idea may take a while.</p>
<h3>Wow, it would be really nice to have some of these graphs on my page...</h3>
<p>Well, funny that you said that. We actually have an API! If you have any interest in using it you can find out more about it
<a href="docs">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Damn, this site is so ugly, someone should do something about it.</h3>
<p>Ouch. But I gotta admit that my design skills are not that good. So, that someone could be you! You could use the issues for this or email me: kaicbastidas(at)gmail(dot)com.</p>
